# Windows programs for reading and writing SPD data

## SPD.zip
This is [EVGAs SPD tool](http://www.evga.com/articles/00466/).

It can read SPD on my system (ASRock P67 EXTREME4), but not write.

This tool doesn't actually write to the RAM SPD; it instead writes to a separate ROM on the motherboard which is only available on EVGA X58 Classified boards.

## SPDTool_063.zip
SPDTool 0.63

Old, moans about incompatible SMBus driver. Can't read or write.
